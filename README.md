# cookieclickerbot
A bot that plays Cookie Clicker!

The goal here was to use Selenium (https://www.selenium.dev/) to create a bot that opens up Chrome and plays Cookie Clicker. The bot has to do a few things:

1. Select the language
2. Click the Cookie
3. Search for any available purchasable upgrades
4. Purchase said upgrade
5. Search for any available items and prioritize the most expensive items first
6. Purchase said items
7. Repeat the loop
